# House-Price-Pediction-with-RandomForest-Model

This project was part of the [Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition. The objective was to predict the sale price of houses using a variety of features like lot size, year built, neighborhood, and overall quality.

In this version, I implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** for modeling. The workflow included:

*  Data preprocessing and handling missing values
  
*  Feature selection and encoding
  
*  Model training using Random Forest

*  Evaluation using **log-transformed RMSE**, as per competition metric


I achieved a **Kaggle leaderboard score of 0.15308 (Log RMSE)** using the Random Forest model.

 A submission file is included, which contains the predicted sale prices for the test dataset generated by the model.
